# "Phoenix" App

This is a personal app built to demonstrate my knowledge in *ReactJS and TypeScript in 2021* and also to show some of my personal art, which is writing :). The texts are written in Portuguese, but the songs which they are based on are in English (Charlotte Cardin, a Canadian singer), so everyone can enjoy it.
